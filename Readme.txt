This is a project made by me and a couple of friends in my sophomore year.

It is an android application which converts most units of a large number of measurement metrics dynamically. The app is optimized for a 7 inch tablet and as such, won't produce optimum visual performance on a screen size less than that. 

The currency part of the app has only four pre-set currencies whose exchange rates are static and unchanged since this application was made. However, users can change the exchange rates for the existing currencies along with being able to add 10 others. 

The main convertor screen is a horizontal scroll widget with tabs which open different screens for the different metrics to be converted amongst. Radio buttons help select the units and our algorithm provides for a continuous conversion for a continuous stream of inputs.

Hope you enjoy the app!
